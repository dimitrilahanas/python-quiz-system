## üìÇ How to Use

1. **Prepare your quiz file**  
   Create a `.txt` file with your questions and answers. The format should look like this:

   ```
   What is the capital of France?|Paris
   Who wrote 'To Kill a Mockingbird'?|Harper Lee
   What is the largest planet in our solar system?|Jupiter
   ```

   Each line should have a question, followed by a pipe (`|`), then the correct answer.

2. **Place your file**  
   Put your quiz file in the same folder as the Python script. For example: `quiz.txt`.

3. **Run the program**  
   Run the Python script using:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Take the quiz!**  
   The program will read the file, turn each question into a multiple-choice question, and let you choose an answer. You‚Äôll get 1 point for each correct answer.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it Works

- The program reads each line from the file and separates the question from the correct answer.
- AI is used to generate 3 similar but incorrect options based on the correct answer.
- The correct answer and AI-generated distractors are shuffled and presented as a multiple-choice question.
- Your score is tracked and shown at the end of the quiz.
